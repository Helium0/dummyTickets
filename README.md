This is my first automation project. I used:

  - Selenium WebDriver
  - TestNG 
  - Maven 

With this project I skilled my abilities in a different ways. I challenged many obstacled with a success and I am planning to add more tests and features soon.
You can clone and adapt my project. 

I followed patters or have tried to follow:
 - Page Object Model is followed which is golden rule for test automation. Page Factory is used in finding the elements.

dataVariables file is presented in src//test//resources. I wanted to place all the crucial data used it tests in one place to be more convenient for usage.

I placed hard assertions and soft assertions I will going to add in different tests also.
